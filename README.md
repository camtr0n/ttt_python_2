# ttt_python_2
Second version of Python 3 unbeatable tic tac toe.

After cloning, change to directory and run:
>python game.py

Game defaults to 3x3 board, moves are mapped to number pad in an intuitive way.
Board size can be set up to 10 in game.py before formatting fails. Only odd sizes should be played.

During any turn, the characters "n" and "N" can be entered to redraw the board with numbers in empty squares to indicate move.
This is typically necessary for board sizes over 3.

Numpad move map:

|   |   |   |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
